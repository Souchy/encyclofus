 * The viewport content encapsulates the component loaded into a viewport

 *
 * During a transition, a viewport has two viewport contents, the current
 * and the next, which is turned back into one when the transition is either
 * finalized or aborted.
 *
 * Viewport contents are used to represent the full component state
 * and can be used for caching.
