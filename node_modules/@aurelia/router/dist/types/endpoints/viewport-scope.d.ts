/**
 * The viewport scope is an endpoint that encapsulates an au-viewport-scope custom
 * element instance. Its content isn't managed by, or even relevant for, the viewport
 * scope since it's only a container custom element. Instead of managing content,
 * the viewport scope provides a way to
 * a) add a routing scope without having to add an actual viewport,
 * b) have segments in routes/paths/instructions without requiring a viewport, and
 * c) make viewports repeatable (something they can't be by themselves) by
 * enclosing them.
 *
 * Since it is an endpoint, the viewport scope is participating in navigations and
 * instructed by the router and navigation coordinator (but with a very simple
 * transition and other navigation actions).
