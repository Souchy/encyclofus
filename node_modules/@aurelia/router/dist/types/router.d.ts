/**
 * The router is the "main entry point" into routing. Its primary responsibilities are
 * - provide configuration api
 * - provide api for adding and finding endpoints (viewport and viewport scope)
 * - provide api for connecting endpoint custom elements to endpoints
 * - provide navigation/load api and inform the navigator about navigation/load instructions
 * - provide informational api regarding ongoing navigation
 * - receive a navigation (instruction) from the navigator and process it
 * - invoke routing hooks when appropriate
 *
 * All navigations roughly follows the same flow:
 * 1) A user action (link click, browser navigation, api call) results in a set of
 * LoadInstructions to the Router, prepared by the corresponding handler (LinkHandler,
 * BrowserViewerStore and Router respectively).
 * 2) The Router enriches the LoadInstruction(s) into a Navigation that's sent to the Navigator.
 * 3) The Navigator enriches the Navigation further, queues it and sends it to the Router for
 * processing.
 * 4) The Router turns, with help from the RoutingScopes, the Navigation into a set of
 * RoutingInstructions.
 * 5) The RoutingInstructions are then, again with the help of the RoutingScopes, matched
 * to the appropriate Endpoints.
 * 6) The Endpoints are informed of their RoutingInstructions.
 * 7) If one of the Endpoints disapprove of their RoutingInstructions (based on the state of
 * their current content, authorization and so on) the Navigation is cancelled.
 * 8) If the Navigation is approved, the Endpoints are instructed to perform their transitions.
 * 9) Once all transitions are completed, the Router informs the Navigatior about the success
 * and the new, complete state.
 * 10) The Navigator saves the new state in the right place (if any) in history and informs
 * the BrowserViewerStore about the new current state.
 * 11) The BrowserViewerStore sends the new state to the browser's Viewer (browser Location url
 * and title) and Store (browser History).
